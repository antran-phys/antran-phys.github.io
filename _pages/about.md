Dr. An Tran joined NPL in January 2022 as a Higher Research Scientist in the Optical Frequency Metrology group, Time & Frequency Department. He obtained a PhD degree from Université Sorbonne Paris Nord in 2019. His PhD thesis focussed on the development of ultra-high resolution molecular spectrometers using ultrastable, widely-tuneable, and SI-traceable quantum cascaded lasers in the mid-infrared domain. He spent two years doing a postdoc at University of Oxford, developing ultra-sensitive continuous-wave cavity-enhanced polarimetry for optical rotation measurement of chiral molecules.

His current research focuses on optical clock-based time scales and ultralow-noise microwave synthesis from ultrastable optical references using frequency combs.
