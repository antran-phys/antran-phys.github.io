Dr. An Tran is a senior scientist at the Time and Frequency Department, National Physical Laboratory -NPL (The UK National Metrology Institue). Since joined NPL in January 2022, his current research focuses on optical clock-based time scales and ultralow-noise microwave synthesis from ultrastable optical references using frequency combs, development of optical frequency combs, and quantum test and evaluation.

He obtained a PhD degree in Physics (frequency metrology and molecular physics) from Université Sorbonne Paris Nord in 2019. His PhD thesis focussed on the development of ultra-high resolution molecular spectrometers using ultrastable, widely-tuneable, and SI-traceable quantum cascaded lasers in the mid-infrared domain. He spent two years doing a postdoc at University of Oxford, developing ultra-sensitive continuous-wave cavity-enhanced polarimetry for optical rotation measurement of chiral molecules.
